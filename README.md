# Andhra-Pradesh-Agriculture-Analytics---2020

🧾 Project Overview:

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard that analyzes the rural farming ecosystem of Andhra Pradesh using official government data from data.gov.in.
The dashboard focuses on agricultural infrastructure, farmer welfare, household amenities, housing vulnerability, and adoption of modern farming practices across districts.
The objective of this project is to transform large-scale public data into actionable insights through effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling.

🎯 Key Objectives:

Analyze irrigation distribution and irrigation gaps across districts
Understand household access to essential amenities such as piped water, food grains, and clean energy
Assess housing and living vulnerability in rural areas
Evaluate the adoption of modern farming practices (soil testing, micro-irrigation, organic farming)
Identify top-performing districts using a multi-metric agricultural performance score

📌 Key Insights:

Andhra Pradesh has approximately 757K hectares irrigated versus 3,011K hectares unirrigated, highlighting a significant irrigation gap.
Only 42.7% of households have access to piped water.
13.5% of farmers are enrolled under the PMKPY pension scheme.
5.2% of farmers have adopted organic farming practices.
59% of households still live in kuccha houses, while 21% have benefited from PMAY housing.
Producer Group participation varies significantly across districts, with some exceeding 30% coverage among farm households.
